    "\n",
    "The most important step when working with textual data is data cleaning, as you can't just go from source text to fitting a machine learning ou deep learning model. \n",
    "In fact, cleaning texts can be a very difficult task and there are several ways you can do this. On this notebook are some functions from the ***re*** (regular expression) and ***nltk*** (natural language toolkit) libraries that you can use to clear textual data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the \"Real/Fake Job Posting Prediction\" dataset available on kaggle. You can check details of this dataset on the link: [https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction]. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset will also be available in this repository, in the \"datasets\" folder. "
